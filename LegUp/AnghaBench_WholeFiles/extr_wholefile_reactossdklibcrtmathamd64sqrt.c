       All that we want, is that the compiler understands that we have the
       function parameter in a register that we can address as an __m128.
       Sadly there is no obvious way to do that. If we use the union, VS will
       generate code to store xmm0 in memory and the read it into a GPR.
       We avoid memory access by using a direct move. But even here we won't
       get a simple MOVSD. We can either do:
       a) _mm_set_sd: move x into the lower part of an xmm register and zero
          out the upper part (XORPD+MOVSD)
       b) _mm_set1_pd: move x into the lower and higher part of an xmm register
         (MOVSD+UNPCKLPD)
       c) _mm_set_pd, which either generates a memory access, when we try to
          tell it to keep the upper 64 bits, or generate 2 MOVAPS + UNPCKLPD
       We choose a, which is probably the fastest.
